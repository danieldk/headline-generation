# Headline generation

## Introduction

This is software that I have written for my MA thesis in 2008 [1]. It
uses transformation based learning (TBL) to learn rules for trimming
newspaper headlines from Alpino dependency trees.

**Warning:** I do not maintain this software, it is made available
as a reference.
